# Project Vision

This file describes the **end goal** of the project, along with the deliverables for it.

## Goal

Create an alternative scout progression for the game, based around continuous upgrades to a single conceptual vehicle, transforming it in the process.

## Deliverables

Ideally the project would result in:

- Cheap starting vehicle, unlocked for all players.
- A set up basic upgrades unlocked by gaining player ranks.
- Alternative body kit(s) for the vehicle.
- Alternative frame(s) for the vehicle, allowing more advanced parts (engines, gearboxes and suspensions).
- A wide collection of tires that is unlocked throughout the progression.

## Vision

Ideal gameplay with this mod is:

Starting the game by purchasing the base vehicle.
Struggling with it until player rank is increased, at which point more options appear for better wheels.
As the player progresses further a new suspension is unlocked, allowing for noticeably larger wheels.
At this point the engine power becomes the limiting factor. As the player progresses further a new engine is unlocked.
The new engine is noticeably less fuel efficient, alternative gearboxes are unlocked that solve the issue.
Even better suspension is unlocked, allowing specialized mud-stompers or chained wheels.
Alternative engine configurations become available as well, changing the behavior of the vehicle completely.

Through exploration (if possible) alternative body frames are unlocked:

- A buggy, allowing for wider wheel placement along with independent suspension.
- A monster-truck, allowing much-much larger wheels and very powerful, yet fuel-hungry engine.

The buggy is a fairly light and nimble improvement to the base scout formula, it's good offroad, however can be bogged down by the mud.
The monster-truck on the other hand has no issues traversing mud, but feels difficult to control and top-heavy at speeds.

Unlike vehicles in the base game, the vehicles are united by the common theme throughout them, uniting it into a single progressive vehicle.
The mod may be expanded to include transforming the same vehicle into a full-blown truck, with still recognizable base.
